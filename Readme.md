# BLazierðŸ¥±

**BLazierðŸ¥±** is an all-in-one React Native application with a Node.js backend (planned) designed to make everyday life easier. It offers multiple small but powerful features, each targeting common life chores and simplifying them.

For example, keeping track of the exact age of all family members can get messy. BLazierðŸ¥± solves this by automatically calculating and keeping track of each family member's age accurately, avoiding manual errors or miscalculations.

## Features

* **Age Tracker:** Keep track of the exact age of all family members effortlessly.
* **Grid-based UI:** Each feature is represented as a box in a neat grid layout, making navigation intuitive.
* **Open to Contributions:** Anyone can contribute new features to make life even simpler.
* **Future Expandable:** Designed with a frontend-backend structure, allowing easy addition of new functionalities.
